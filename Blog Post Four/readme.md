# Weekly Blog Post Four: Adding Scenes

I have added another scene to my project. In this scene, the player is teleported to another environment and their objective is to explore the place and complete the quest. As shown in the video, I was able to implement movement control to move around in this scene.

This scene also includes an underwater quest where the player needs to deep deep to find the hidden treasure. Creating underwater effect was tricky, so it required a lot of time and debugging. Now that I have it running, I will able to add more objectss and characters to make this scene more complete.
