# Weekly Blog Post Three: Adding Avatar and Objects

I continued to work on my avatar and was able to add textures and animation to him, as soon in the video below.

My avatar will be standing infront of Angkor Wat, waving and welcoming players to explore this place. I will work more on my avatar to add movements and interactions with players. 


I also worked on the environment of my project. I added grassland around the temple as well as created a moat outside the wall of Angkor Wat.
