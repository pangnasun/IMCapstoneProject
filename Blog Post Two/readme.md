# Weekly Blog Post Two: Creating Characters

## 3D Modeling
I have been using Maya to create 3D characters. The current characters that I am working on are an avatar of me and a soldier.

## Adding animations
I also started to implement animations into these 3D models, so I can add them to my scenes in Unity.
